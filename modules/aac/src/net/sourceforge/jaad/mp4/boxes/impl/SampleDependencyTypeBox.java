/**
 * This optional table answers three questions about sample dependency:
 * <ul>
 * <li>does this sample depend on others (is it an I-picture)?</li>
 * <li>do no other samples depend on this one?</li>
 * <li>does this sample contain multiple (redundant) encodings of the data at
 * this time-instant (possibly with different dependencies)?</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * In the absence of this table:
 * <ul>
 * <li>the sync sample table answers the first question; in most video codecs,
 * I-pictures are also sync points</li>
 * <li>the dependency of other samples on this one is unknown</li>
 * <li>the existence of redundant coding is unknown</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * When performing 'trick' modes, such as fast-forward, it is possible to use
 * the first piece of information to locate independently decodable samples.
 * Similarly, when performing random access, it may be necessary to locate the
 * previous sync point or random access recovery point, and roll-forward from
 * the sync point or the pre-roll starting point of the random access recovery
 * point to the desired point. While rolling forward, samples on which no others
 * depend need not be retrieved or decoded.
 * The value of 'sample is depended on' is independent of the existence of
 * redundant codings. However, a redundant coding may have different
 * dependencies from the primary coding; if redundant codings are available, the
 * value of 'sample depends on' documents only the primary coding.
 *
 * A Sample Dependency Box may also occur in the Track Fragment Box.
