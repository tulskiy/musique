 * track time-line: by mapping part of the media time-line, or by indicating
 * 'empty' time, or by defining a 'dwell', where a single time-point in the
 * media is held for a period.
 *
 * Starting offsets for tracks (streams) are represented by an initial empty
 * edit. For example, to play a track from its start for 30 seconds, but at 10
 * seconds into the presentation, we have the following edit list:
 *
 * [0]:
 * Segment-duration = 10 seconds
 * Media-Time = -1
 * Media-Rate = 1
 *
 * [1]:
 * Segment-duration = 30 seconds (could be the length of the whole track)
 * Media-Time = 0 seconds
 * Media-Rate = 1
